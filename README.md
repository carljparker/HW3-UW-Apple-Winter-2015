### How was your experience making this app? ###



### What resources did you find helpful? ###
Actually, I think the most helpful resource overall was Xcode itself and
the realtime way that it would flag my code when I would start to go off
course. For someone like me, who is just starting out with Objective-C,
this really helped to prevent me from making a lot of simple mistakes.

The articles on enumeration were also helpful. Using `for id obj in
collection` is much nicer than using a traditional for (;;;) loop.

### One well-formed question or observation about the app, technologies used, or related topics. ###

Is there any way that I can call **controlTextDidChange** directly from
my code? Or can it be called only by the system?
